### Explanation of Each Line (For the 'Forecast' - JS)

1. **`forecast.list.forEach(item => {`**:
   - This line starts a loop over each item in the `forecast.list` array. The `forecast.list` array contains weather data objects for every 3-hour interval fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **`const date = new Date(item.dt * 1000);`**:
   - `item.dt` is a Unix timestamp (in seconds) representing the date and time of the forecast. By multiplying `item.dt` by 1000, we convert it to milliseconds (which is the expected input for JavaScript's `Date` object). This creates a `Date` object representing the date and time of the forecast.

3. **`const day = date.toISOString().split('T')[0];`**:
   - `date.toISOString()` converts the `Date` object to a string in ISO format (e.g., `2023-07-27T12:00:00.000Z`).
   - `.split('T')[0]` splits this string at the 'T' character and takes the first part, which is the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This effectively groups the forecasts by day.

4. **`if (!dailyForecasts[day]) {`**:
   - This checks if there is already an entry in the `dailyForecasts` object for the current day. If not, it initializes an empty array for that day.

5. **`dailyForecasts[day] = [];`**:
   - This initializes an empty array for the current day in the `dailyForecasts` object. This step is only executed if the day did not previously exist in the `dailyForecasts` object.

6. **`dailyForecasts[day].push(item);`**:
   - This adds the current forecast item to the array for the current day in the `dailyForecasts` object.

7. **`let displayedDays = 0;`**:
   - This initializes a counter to keep track of how many days have been displayed so far. The goal is to limit the forecast display to the next 6 days.

8. **`Object.keys(dailyForecasts).forEach(day => {`**:
   - This starts a loop over the keys (days) in the `dailyForecasts` object. `Object.keys(dailyForecasts)` returns an array of the keys (i.e., the dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format).

9. **`const dayForecasts = dailyForecasts[day];`**:
   - This retrieves the array of forecast items for the current day from the `dailyForecasts` object.

10. **`if (day === today) {`**:
    - This checks if the current day being processed is today's date. `today` is a string representing the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

11. **`dailyForecasts[day] = dayForecasts.filter(item => {`**:
    - This filters the forecast items for today to include only those that are from the current time onwards. It overwrites the current day's forecast array with this filtered array.

12. **`const itemDate = new Date(item.dt * 1000);`**:
    - This converts the forecast item's Unix timestamp to a `Date` object.

13. **`return itemDate >= now;`**:
    - This returns `true` if the forecast item's date and time is greater than or equal to the current date and time (`now`). This ensures only future forecasts for today are included.
